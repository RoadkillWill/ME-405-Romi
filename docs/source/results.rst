The following video shows our fastest successful attempt of driving the course. Our Romi completed the course in 39 seconds, but this does not account for the 5 second time deduction we achieved by pushing the second cup out of the zone. Due to this, the net time for this time trial is 34 seconds.

Our Romi successfully completed the course multiple times, with our fastest time shown in the video. Although we couldn't achieve completion in every attempt, the failures were due to specific issues: either the IR sensor failing to detect the dot on Checkpoint #4, or the headings being reset unexpectedly, causing the Romi to turn right and crash into the metal frame that was meant to be avoided.
